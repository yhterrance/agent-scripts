# Beeper

Use this for local Beeper history questions, especially vague contact hints across iMessage/WhatsApp bridges.

## Source

- DB: `~/Library/Application Support/BeeperTexts/index.db`
- FTS: `mx_room_messages_fts`

Start by inspecting accounts/rooms before broad searching.

## Workflow

1. Identify likely account/bridge/room from `accounts`, `participants`, and room tables.
2. Use FTS for text discovery.
3. Narrow by date, participant, and room.
4. Report room/account names, date spans, and confidence.

Useful probes:

```bash
sqlite3 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/BeeperTexts/index.db" \
  "select * from accounts limit 20;"
```

```bash
sqlite3 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/BeeperTexts/index.db" \
  "select rowid, content from mx_room_messages_fts where mx_room_messages_fts match 'query' limit 20;"
```

Keep results local; this DB can contain private messages.
